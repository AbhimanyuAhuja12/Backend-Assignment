Here In this Assigment we have to Implement the union function of 2 Arrays.
Order should be maintained , and obviously no duplicate should come 
We have to make it for Generic type : function must work for->
                                                primitives
                                                Plain objects 
                                                Arrays
                                                Nested Objects also
We have to deep equality check , can't use json.Stringfy()

Also we have to write test case using jest
